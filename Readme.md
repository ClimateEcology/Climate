# Plants, Pollinators, and Climate

This project is a Penn State - USDA collaboration.

## Climate Indices

We are looking at ways to describe climate that makes sense for organisms living on the landscape.



## Climate Data Variability

The objective of this section of the project is to characterize the effects of climate gridding algorithms on the values of climate indices such as BIOCLIM and CLIMDEX.
